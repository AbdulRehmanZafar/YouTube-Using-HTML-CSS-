This is a YouTube clone I built using pure HTML and CSS to practice front-end web development. It replicates the basic layout of the YouTube homepage, including the header, sidebar, thumbnails, and video info sections.

This project helped me understand how to use Flexbox, grid layouts, positioning, and responsive design techniques.
